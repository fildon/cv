      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a motivated multidisciplinary staff software engineer with over 10
        years of professional experience. I have worked closely with
        high-profile clients and gained both deep and broad expertise. My roles
        have included full stack development, software architecture and team
        leadership. I am a firm believer in collaboration across product, design
        and development domains. I can work alone, but am most valuable as a
        multiplier to others. I am passionate about clean code, test driven
        development and mentoring others.
